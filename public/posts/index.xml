      <description>Napping is a medium difficulty box from TryHackMe which had a interesting vulnerability called Tab Nabbing to phish the admin of the website to get user daniel&amp;rsquo;s credentials by which we could ssh into the box. We then alter a python file which is run every minute by user adrian to get a reverse shell back as that user. For root, we could execute vim as root . So we refer GTFOBINS for sudo entry for vim binary to elevate our privileges to root.</description>

      <description>Git and Crumpets is a medium difficulty box from tryhackme which is mostly based on git. We get a shell on the box using a CVE in gitea&amp;rsquo;s git hooks functionality .For root, we change the permissions of the git user to root user. Now we were able to see a private repository owned by root which had root user&amp;rsquo;s ssh private key through which we login as root to get the root flag.</description>

      <description>Lumberjack Turtle is a medium difficulty box from Tryhackme which is entirely focused on Log4j/Log4shell a 0-day vulnerability that caused a havoc on the internet . The website is vulnerable to Log4j &amp;amp; so we&amp;rsquo;re able to exploit it and get a shell on the box . We find a .dockerenv file in the / directory which indicates we are on a docker container. To obtain the root flag , we mount the /dev/xvda1 disk partition since it contains the entire filesystem(/) to access all the files .</description>

      <description>Summary - OpenAdmin from HackTheBox is an easy-rated machine which involves an exploit for OpenNetAdmin to get a foothold on the machine. There are 2 users on the box Jimmy and Joanna . We get the password for Jimmy via database config file &amp;amp; then ssh as Jimmy, then on enumerating we find an internal application running.Doing a simple curl command reveals id_rsa key of Joanna. We then crack the password of the id_rsa file and ssh into the machine as Joanna.</description>
